# SAM Software Automatic Mouth

## What is SAM?

This is a Go port of the Text-To-Speech (TTS) software SAM (Software Automatic Mouth) for the Commodore C64, published in 1982 by Don't Ask Software (now SoftVoice, Inc.).

It is based on the adaptation to C by [Stefan Macke](https://github.com/s-macke/SAM)

## Status

The "English to ARPABET" translation works, but the rest is a work in progress.
